## Image Splitter

Splits images into square tiles, like Discord emojis. Version 3!

## What's New

- Cooler and friendlier UI.
- Much faster! See benchmarks section below.
- Now supports pasting URLs and images directly.
- Live preview of the image and split tiles, with panning/zooming capabilities.
- Togglable light/dark theme.

## Future

- Webp output support
- Shrink to fit one server (like V1)

## Privacy

All of the work happens client-side (i.e. I don't store any of your images).

## Development

`image-splitter` runs on SolidJS and Vite. To get started, install the required dependencies by running `yarn` and start the development server with `yarn dev`.

When developing on Firefox, use `yarn build && yarn serve` instead. Loses HMR, but gets rid of some annoying problems involving web workers.
